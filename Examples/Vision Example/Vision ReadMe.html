<h1 style="text-align: center;">FRC 2015 LabVIEW Vision Example</h1>
<br>
The vision examples for the My Computer section are intended to open on the laptop or desktop computer and not on the roboRIO. They can be used to compare approaches, algorithms, and cameras. They allow for quick experimentation or calibration of vision code before you have access to a roboRIO. They can be used as a basis for dashboard based vision processing. If you are looking for the roboRIO example, open the roboRIO target in the project window.

<br><br>
The Tutorials tab of the LabVIEW Getting Started Window contains step-by-step information for integration with robot and dashboard code.
<br><br>


The example comes with a collection of sample images. You can also change to the camera tab and enter in your camera's address. The kit USB camera will typically be "USB 0" or "USB 1" depending on whether the computer has a built-in webcam. Axis cameras from previous year kits can be accessed at their fixed IP address, or using "axis-camera.local" -- provided that is their host name. Older Axis cameras often use their axis-serial number as the default host name. The host name can be modified using the web-based camera configuration utility.

The FRC Color Processing Example.vi uses tote color, carpet color, sizing dimensions and profile shape as the primary identifiers.
<br><br>
The FRC Color and Shape Processing Example.vi uses tote color as an initial locator, then uses a trained shape such as the logo for more precise detection.
<br><br>
The FRC Retroreflective Processing Example uses the bright reflection from a ring light and the geometric shape of the tape symbol for detection. By default it is setup for a colored ring light, but can be modified to use only intensity.
